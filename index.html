        <p>Hello, my name is Jared Alaniz Baylon and I am from Puebla. I enjoy working with electronics, and
            electrical devices. I like to know new people and listen to their stories.
            I am working in Mexico and I like play basketball with my children. Futhermore, I was born in a small town
            called Teotlalcingo
            in the state of Puebla near the Iztaccihuatl Mountain. when I was a kid, I enjoyed playing in the field of
            my house along with my
            brothers and friends. I grew up learning from my parents about hard work and the importance of going to
            school. I learned welding in
            secundary school and I started to play basketball at 11. Since then I play this beautiful sport during my
            whole life. I studied preparatory school in Mexico City, then I went to a mission and then I came back to
            study
            in the school of engineering in Puebla City. I got married in 2005, and today I enjoy the family.</p>
